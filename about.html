          <h2><span>About to</span> Ahmet Duser</h2>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p id="aboutToAhmetDuser"><strong>I was born and brought up in Turkey, my father is electronics Engineer and my mother is a housewife.
            My parents have always laid great importance on Education and both of them are very progressive and modern in their thoughts.
            It was my father who inspired me to become passionate about Engineering, especially about Computer Systems Engineering.
            I watched my dad work on different circuits and programs and I always wondered if I would ever become a successful person like my dad.
            My dad always supported me and the choices I made. I completed my high school in Turkey.
            After my high school, we moved to UAE because my father got a job as a project manager in a Multinational Technology Company based in Switzerland.</strong><br /> <br />
            I wasn’t expecting to move to a new place, but I found it a good change for all of us.
            I realized after moving to UAE that we can learn a lot more by just living in a foreign country, for example, we learn about different cultures, new languages and most importantly we learn how to adapt to new environment.
            I joined Middlesex University (Mdx), where I finished the International Foundation program for Engineering in 2019.
            Successful completion of this foundation program leads to year one of University Degree. I have involved various group projects during IFP and created many portfolios such as; video presentation (group project), Arduino circuit project and MeArm Robotics Project.
            After IFP, I completed year one Undergraduate degree Computer Systems Engineering in Mdx. I improved my existing computer skills during the first year and I added new skills such as Java and Computer Networks.
            I have been taking online courses since the beginning of my university journey, such as SQL, Java, and Cloud Computing.
            I have various online certificates and I have been contributing to open source community through GitHub. I have no work experience until now.
            I have several volunteering experiences in technology conferences and summits.
            Working as part of group in university made me realize that we can benefit a lot by working together as a team and working with students from different backgrounds makes us learn in so many different ways that we can’t even imagine.
            I had selected a mathematics-physics field for my High School education to fulfill my eagerness to contribute to computer technologies. Also, the bulk of my higher grades are composed of science subjects. Since childhood,
            I have been an active participant in computer-based programs and extracurricular activities related to it. The importance of Computer Systems is gradually increasing all over the world nowadays.
            Apart from my dad, being a major motivational factor in choosing Computer majors, my teachers have always had a positive influence on me. They are confident that I will make a good Engineer.</p>
